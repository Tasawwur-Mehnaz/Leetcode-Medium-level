Given a binary tree root, a node X in the tree is named good if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.
Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

Example 1:
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are good.
Root Node (3) is always a good node.
Node 4 -> (3,4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
Node 5 -> (3,4,5) is the maximum value in the path
Node 3 -> (3,1,3) is the maximum value in the path.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    void process(TreeNode* root,int max,int &ans)
    {
        if(root==NULL)
            return;
        if(max<=root->val)
        {
            max=root->val;
            ans++;
        }
        process(root->left,max,ans);
        process(root->right,max,ans);
    }
    int goodNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        int ans=0;
        process(root,INT_MIN,ans);
        return ans;
    }
};
